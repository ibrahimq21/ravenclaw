  -d '{
    "to": "recipient@domain.com",
    "subject": "Leave Request",
    "body": "Dear Manager,\n\nI would like to request leave...",
    "target_time": "2026-02-20T09:00:00",
    "priority": "high"
  }'
```

### Using JSON Queue

Copy `example-schedule.json` to `ravenclaw_scheduled.json` and add your emails:

```bash
cp example-schedule.json ravenclaw_scheduled.json
# Edit ravenclaw_scheduled.json with your email content
```

### Scheduled Email Schema

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "emails": [
    {
      "id": "unique_id",
      "to": "recipient@domain.com",
      "subject": "Email subject",
      "body": "Email body content",
